# The Block That Runs Away

I wanted to learn how mouse events and eventListeners worked in JavaScript. So I started out by creating a CodePen where a small white block movews when my mouse hovers over it. You can see it [here.](https://codepen.io/ParnaHere/pen/XWXemJQ)

However, I was inspired to develop that into a game where I could keep points for the number of times someone "caught" the _block that runs away_(hence the name)!
CodePen doesn't support projects with multiple pages well, so I programmed it on VS Code, and hosted it using Firebase. You can see the [final project here.](https://blocksrunning.web.app/) 

I hope you enjoy the game!
